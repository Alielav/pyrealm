0.1.0 - First release of pyrealm. Implementation of P model
0.1.1 - (aka hotfix/bed_setup). Fixing problems in setup.py
0.1.2 - Fixing problems with setup for PyPi publication.
0.1.3 - Clipping negative values in calc_ftemp_kphio
0.1.4 - Rescaled ftemp_kphio to remove double division error
      - Disabled C4 pytests while rpmodel retains this issue.
0.2.0 - Implementation of the T model
0.3.0 - Refactor of parameter classes into param_classes module with
        consistent ParamClass baseclass for import/export and dataclass
        based interface.
0.3.1 - Restructure of requirements and install_requires for better pip install
0.4.0 - Refactor of the PModel to separate calc of gammastar etc, from
        the pmodel itself: PModelEnvironment and PModel classes.
      - Implementation of ConstrainedArray class to clip inputs to
        biologically meaningful ranges and to identify that clipping
        has occurred. Particular issue with serious numerical instablility
        in calc_density_h2o, but now adopted a general solution to clipping
        inputs.
      - Expansion of PModel testing to include a global array giving a wider
        range of inputs including edge cases.
	  - Created option for using a rootzonestress option (Rodolfo Nobrega)
