0.1.0 - First release of pyrealm. Implementation of P model
0.1.1 - (aka hotfix/bad_setup). Fixing problems in setup.py
0.1.2 - Fixing problems with setup for PyPi publication.
0.1.3 - Clipping negative values in calc_ftemp_kphio
0.1.4 - Rescaled ftemp_kphio to remove double division error
      - Disabled C4 pytests while rpmodel retains this issue.
0.2.0 - Implementation of the T model
0.3.0 - Refactor of parameter classes into param_classes module with
        consistent ParamClass baseclass for import/export and dataclass
        based interface.
0.3.1 - Restructure of requirements and install_requires for better pip install
0.4.0 - Refactor of the PModel to separate calc of gammastar etc, from
        the pmodel itself: PModelEnvironment and PModel classes.
      - Implementation of ConstrainedArray class to clip inputs to
        biologically meaningful ranges and to identify that clipping
        has occurred. Particular issue with serious numerical instability
        in calc_density_h2o, but now adopted a general solution to clipping
        inputs.
      - Expansion of PModel testing to include a global array giving a wider
        range of inputs including edge cases.
	  - Created option for using a rootzonestress option (Rodolfo Nobrega)
0.5.0 - Refactor of constrained_array modules to use a class factory that
        acts as both a constraint and a check on existing constraint types.
      - Implementation of the utilities module, currently including some
        hygrometric conversions and shared utility functions.
      - Refactor of PModel and Iabs scaling
      - Better __repr__ and new summarize() functions in pmodel module.
0.5.1 - Minor tweaks to utilities param classes
      - Backtrack on constrained_arrays - unexpected issues with chained use.
        Currently just turning off a single constraint.
0.5.2 - Fix for critical bug in mj calculation - using masked arrays is fragile, need
        to consider this - and the constraint approach which generates masked
        inputs.
0.5.3 - Replaced ConstrainedArray and masked arrays with input_bounds_checker
        and 'masking' using np.nan. See notes in pyrealm/bounds_checker.py. This
        was revisited even before release to remove built in masking completely
        and just provide some warnings on sane ranges. A hard limit for temps
        < 25Â°C is imposed due to the behaviour of calc_density_h2o.
0.5.4 - Updated CalcOptimalChi to return an actual estimate of chi for C4 
        plants, not just 1.0. Updated documentation and examples to illustrate.
