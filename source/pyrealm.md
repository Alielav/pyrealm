# The `pyrealm` package


## The `pmodel` module

See [here](pyrealm.pmodel).

## Documentation

The documentation for `pyrealm` is maintained using `sphinx`. The module code is
documented using Google style docstrings in RST format. Much of the rest of the
documentation uses Jupyter notebooks written using `myst-nb` format in order to
dynamically include Python code examples showing the behaviour of functions. In
general, the code will be concealed but the underlying code can be seen by
clicking on the buttons like the one below. 

```{code-cell} python
:tags: [hide-input]
# This is just an example code cell to demonstrate how code is included in 
# the pyrealm documentation.
```
