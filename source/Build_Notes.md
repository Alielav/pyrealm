## Documentation

The documentation for this package uses `sphinx` and the `sphinx-material` theme.
The API docstrings use the [Google style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) 
and equations are supported using the `sphinx.ext.mathjax extension`.

The docstrings are formatted using `.rst`, which is better supported, but some
of the documentation files use `markdown` via the `recommonmark` extension to 
`sphinx`. A contributed package is used for bibliographic management.

```bash
pip install sphinx sphinx-material recommonmark sphinxcontrib-bibtex
```

To build the documentation, use `make` in the package root, which will use the 
`Makefile` created by `sphinx-quickstart`.

```bash
make html
```

## Testing

### Using `doctest`

The package docstrings contain `doctest` examples of code use. These are 
intended to demonstrate use and to validate a reference set of inputs against
the R implementation in `rpmodel`. They do not provide extensive unit testing!
To run the docstring tests, use:

```bash
python -m doctest pypmodel/pmodel.py

``` 

## Bibliography

TODO - it would be nice to have the bibliographies autogenerated and 
sphinxcontrib-bibtex does this but in a kinda ugly way:
